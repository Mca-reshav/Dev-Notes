regex flags:

1. global(g): const regex = /pattern/g; : It will match all occurences in input string, not just first one

2. case-insensitive(i): const regex = /pattern/i; : It will match cases of character

3. multiline(m): const regex = /pattern/m; : This flag changes the behavior of ^ and $ so that they match the start or end of each line

4. singleLine or dotAll(s): const regex = /pattern/s;  : To match any character including newline \n

5. unicode(u): const regex = /pattern/u; : To match unicode, useful in working with characters outside the ASCII range

6. sticky(y): const regex = /pattern/y; : To match only from the index indicated by lastIndex
