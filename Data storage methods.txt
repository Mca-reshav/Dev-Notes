Data storage methods

Cookie vs Local Storage vs Session

1. Cookie: Safe by setting attributes like: Http only, secure and same site to store auth tokens and sent with every http request that makes it slow (4KB)
2. Local Storage: faster performance and sync operations makes suitable for storing larger amount of data (5MB)
3.Session: Fast as local but used for storing temporary data as session will get ended like browser get closed
