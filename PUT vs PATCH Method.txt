PUT vs PATCH Method

1. Data transfer and bandwidth:
	
	PUT: It send the entire representation of resource, results in higher data transfer and bandwidth usage
	PATCH: Allow you to send only the changes, beneficial in terms of costs

2. Server processing:

	PUT: More resource-intensive as it handling entire payload
	PATCH: Request involves applying partial updates

3. Caching:

	PUT: Less effective as entire resource is expected to change
	PATCH: More effective, especially if app supports conditional requests(e.g., ETags)

4. Client-Side considerations:

	PUT: Need to send entire updated representation
	PATCH: Need to handle partial updates *may become complex
