
// SQL Practice

1. LEAST: It is not an aggregate function like MIN/MAX but it is used to return the minimum value among arguments

2. COALESCE: It is used to return the first value that is not null, alternative of if null 

3. STORED PROCEDURE: 
	
	CREATE PROCEDURE <name(arguments)>
		BEGIN
			IF
			END IF
			ELSE
			.
			.
			.
		END;

4. Second highest salary: using offset to skip the limit by 1 

SELECT * FROM empData WHERE salary < (SELECT salary FROM empData ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

without offset: SELECT * FROM empData WHERE salary < (SELECT salary FROM empData ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1) LIMIT 1

5. Rename the table: ALTER TABLE epmData RENAME TO empData

6. SQL Transaction: (Books Stock inventory management)
	
	
7. find third highest:

SELECT * FROM empData WHERE salary = ( SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM empData ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2);// to retreive all info
SELECT salary FROM empData ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2 // only salary of third highest

without using offset

SELECT MAX(salary) AS third_highest_salary FROM empData WHERE salary NOT IN ( SELECT salary FROM empData ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2 );


8. Alter table to add mulitple col

ALTER TABLE cust_tbl  
ADD cust_address varchar(100) NOT NULL  
AFTER cust_surname,  
ADD cust_salary int(100) NOT NULL  
AFTER cust_age ; 

9. find the duplicate record

SELECT GeekRank, COUNT(GeekID) AS DuplicateRanks
FROM Geeks
GROUP BY GeekRank
HAVING COUNT(GeekRank)>1;

delete the duplicate record

DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)  -- or MAX(id) depending on which record you want to keep
    FROM your_table
    GROUP BY name
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);


10. col names and details 

SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'user_pancard_details'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION

SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `user_pancard_details`
